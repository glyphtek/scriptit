## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+
- Git

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/scriptit.git
   cd scriptit
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash

3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   bun test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style
We use Biome for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
bun run format

# Lint code
bun run lint

# Check and fix issues
bun run check
```

### Testing
- Write tests for new features in the `tests/` directory
- Run tests before submitting PRs: `bun test`
- Test both CLI and library functionality
- Include integration tests for complex features

### Project Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ common/          # Shared utilities and types
â”œâ”€â”€ core/            # Core functionality (config, execution)

â”œâ”€â”€ lib.ts           # Library API
